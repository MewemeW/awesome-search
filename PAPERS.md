Amazon is one of the world’s largest e-commerce sites and
Amazon Search powers the majority of Amazon’s sales. As a
consequence, even small improvements in relevance ranking
both positively influence the shopping experience of millions
of customers and significantly impact revenue. In the past,
Amazon’s product search engine consisted of several handtuned ranking functions using a handful of input features.
A lot has changed since then. In this talk we are going
to cover a number of relevance algorithms used in Amazon
Search today. We will describe a general machine learning
framework used for ranking within categories, blending separate rankings in All Product Search, NLP techniques used
for matching queries and products, and algorithms targeted
at unique tasks of specific categories — books and fashion.
